    <p>Using the Roles as Rights feature, you can present specific content to viewers based on their assigned roles. The following content types can be shown or hidden based on the viewer's role:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Movies</li>
      <li>Programs</li>
      <li>Seasons</li>
      <li>Series</li>
      <li>Episodes</li>
      <li>Channels</li>
      <li>Live Events</li>
      <li>Playlists</li>
      <li>Pages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the Beacon CMS, you are able to create roles and assign them to each each content type listed above.</p>
    <p>You will then use your OIDC roles claim URL to associate viewers with roles. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol used to verify the identity of a user to a client service.</p>
    <p> For details about using OIDC, see the <a href="/references/oidc-authentication-for-beacon.html">OIDC Authentication Configuration and Testing</a> document.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>Unsupported features:</h3>
