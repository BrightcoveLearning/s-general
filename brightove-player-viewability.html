    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The viewability of a player is of fundamental importance to advertising integrations as well as some UI treatments like floating players. In this context, we define “viewability” as the percentage of a player visible in the browser viewport at any given moment. A player is considered “viewable” if some specific percentage of the player is in the viewport.</p>
    <p>Brightcove Player 7 introduces viewability tracking DOM events and some valuable behaviors that depend on the player’s viewable state.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Please note that the viewability feature is only available for Brightcove Player 7, and no migration is needed.</aside>

    <p>The player's viewability events and behavior can be configured in your player's JSON configuration. All configurations are available under the viewability property.</p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>Here's the JSON for a player configuration which includes viewability:</p>
      <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-json" translate="No">{
  ... other properties ...
  &quot;viewability&quot;: {
    &quot;viewability_threshold&quot;: 0.3,
    &quot;pause_when_not_viewable&quot;: true
  }
}</code></pre>
      <p>In this example, playback pauses when less than 30% of the player is visible in the browser viewport, caused by the user scrolling the player out of view. Playback resumes when the player becomes visible again.</p>

        <li>
          <p><h3><code translate="No">viewable-percent-change</code></h3></p>
          <p>This event fires when the viewable percentage of the player changes.</p>
          <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"><p>The frequency of this event can be influenced by the <code translate="No">threshold_percentage_increment</code> configuration, but it can fire quite often. This means performing any computationally expensive operation on this event could degrade performance.</p> 
            The recommendation is to use it only if it's really needed. Most use-cases just want to know when the player moves to or from a viewable state and should use the <code translate="No">viewable-change</code> event.</aside>
