    <p>The viewer login duration is dependent on the login token and refresh token. Here are the rules for their duration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The login token is good for one week.</li>
      <li>The refresh token is good for one month.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If authentication is required, the viewer must use their login credentials to use the Beacon app. The question is then how long is the duration of successful login valid. The answer to this question is controlled by the duration of the login and refresh tokens.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>login token</strong> duration sets how long the viewer can use the app without re-authenticating. For instance, if the login duration is five days, every five days the viewer will have to use credentials to login again.</li>
      <li>As a courtesy to viewers, you may wish to not force them to login too frequently, but still insure security. This is where a <strong>refresh token</strong> can be used.</li>
